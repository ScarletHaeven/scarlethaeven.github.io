    <p class="section-content">
        I go by <i>ScarletHaeven</i> online, Scarlet for short. I'm a guy from the Netherlands who
        enjoys music, games, and (sometimes) programming.

        I'm still working on this website, so anything you see here might change sometime in the future.

    <h3 class="section-title">Music</h3>
    <p class="section-content">
        Music might just be one of my favorite things, period.
        Ever since April of 2022, when a friend got me into <i>Metallica</i>, my music taste has changed
        from purely EDM and VGM to so, so much
        more.
        I discovered so many new albums over the last couple of years, and I'm glad I did!
        I'm still finding new favorites to this day, and it's very enjoyable.

    <h3 class="section-title">Games</h3>
    <p class="section-content">
        Of course, I enjoy playing games!
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">What kind of games?</p>

    <p class="section-content">
        Well, I can't really say that I have a defining genre I particularly like - I enjoy playing all
        kinds of games.
        But I do like playing roguelikes/roguelites often, as well as story-based games.
        I've also been getting into (psychological) horror games, I really enjoy those as well.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">Here are some games I enjoy(ed) playing:</p>
    <ul class="section-content">
        <li></li>
        <li>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</li>
        <li>Slime Rancher</li>
        <li>Subnautica</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section-content">
        Feel free to check my Steam page too (you can find it at the <u ng-click="togglePage('socials')">socials</u> section) if you're
        curious about if I've played any other games in particular.

    <h3 class="section-title">Touhou</h3>
    <p class="section-content">
        I've been a Touhou fan/player for about 4 years now, and it's become one of my favorite
        franchises ever.
        Hell, one of my favorite characters in fiction is <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Koishi_Komeiji"
            target="_blank">Koishi Komeiji</a>,
        my favorite character in Touhou.
        I've 1cc'd all the games on Lunatic, and I have a few LNBs under my belt too.
        As for the Extra stages, I have ExNB'd all of them, and I have ExNNs of a couple of stages as
        well.

    <h3 class="section-title">Programming</h3>

    <p class="section-content">
        I currently work as a software developer (primarily web-development) at a metal processing
        company.
        The languages I currently know are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
        I also know how to use a JS framework (AngularJS), albeit an outdated one.
        I do plan on learning C# soon, but my current focus is improving on the languages I already know
        (and maybe
        learning a modern JS framework, lol).
