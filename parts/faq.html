    <h3 class="section-content question-title">Q: What's with that quote you use everywhere?</h3>
    <p class="section-content">I'm glad you asked!</p>
    <p class="section-content">
        The quote is actually a line from a Jerry Cantrell song called <em>Prism of Doubt</em>.
        As you probably know, the lyric goes as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="section-content"><i>"I can't believe how far we've come!"</i></p>

    <p class="section-content">
        And, as you've most likely seen already, I use this lyric on 90% of my social media, as a part
        of my description/bio.
        Why is that?
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
        Well, for one, I consider this my favorite lyric ever for a couple of reasons.
        I think it's a really simple lyric to understand - clearly the lyric is about someone expressing
        surprise/joy about how far they've came so far.
        But the main reasons why this lyric means a lot to me are both the artist's perspective and what
        this lyric means to me personally.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
        Jerry Cantrell suffered a <i>lot</i> during his career, especially during the creation of
        Degradation Trip.
        Not only that, but his best friend - Layne Staley, the former frontman of Alice In
        Chains - passed away due to an overdose in 2002.
        Needless to say, life was incredibly rough for him.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
        But after the release of Degradation Trip, he slowly started recovering from what had happened.
        Alice In Chains revived in 2009, with new member William DuVall, and things were going
        swimmingly.
        Fast forward to 2021, and Jerry Cantrell releases Brighten.
        An album which, if it wasn't obvious from the name, is the most postitive-sounding album in his
        discography.
        So, to me, I feel like the lyric represents how far Cantrell has gotten since those dark days.
    </p>

    <p class="section-content">
        As for what the lyric means to me... well, I suppose it's somewhat similar to what I explained
        earlier.
        Every day I'm glad that I've gotten as far as I did.
        I struggled with a lot of things, and I still struggle with some things.
        And that's okay!
        I'm still very proud of myself for getting so far in life.
